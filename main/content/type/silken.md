<u>what</u>: Silken tofu is typically undrained, unpressed Japanese-style tofu with the highest water content and a custardy texture. Ultra-smooth and jiggly soft, silken tofu is most commonly used for pur√©eing as a base for soups, dips, and sauces. It also makes excellent dessert puddings and pie fillings.
