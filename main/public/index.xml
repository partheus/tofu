      <description>what: Silken tofu is typically undrained, unpressed Japanese-style tofu with the highest water content and a custardy texture. Ultra-smooth and jiggly soft, silken tofu is most commonly used for pur√©eing as a base for soups, dips, and sauces. It also makes excellent dessert puddings and pie fillings.
suggested recipes: protein shake, vegan mayo, creamy dips, gravy dishes</description>

      <description>what: Also called &amp;ldquo;block&amp;rdquo; tofu or &amp;ldquo;medium&amp;rdquo; tofu. Used very commonly for generic cooking purposes.
